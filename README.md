## 🌟 About the Collection

**Python Mini Games Collection** is a curated set of five interactive Python projects — from terminal-based logic games to a real-time graphical experience with Pygame.

Each game is independently runnable, purposefully minimal, and built to demonstrate a distinct set of Python programming concepts. Whether you're here to play, learn, or fork — there's something for every level.

| Dimension | Detail |
|---|---|
| 🎯 **Purpose** | Portfolio showcase & Python fundamentals demonstration |
| 🧱 **Architecture** | Standalone scripts — no cross-dependencies |
| 🎮 **Game Types** | Real-time (Pygame) + Interactive CLI |
| 👥 **Audience** | Beginners, learners, and Python enthusiasts |
